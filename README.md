# futtrack

> As a soccer fan I wanted a quick overview of all the upcoming matches for a few leagues I try to follow. I decided to develop a website that would show me all the upcoming games on a single page. I used an open source API called football-data.org and VueJs as my framework to digest this information and display the matches for the day. I also implemented a search feature to narrow down the results by team. The site is deployed on heroku.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test

# deploy to heroku
npm run deploy
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


### Planned updates

* Show a user defined amount of games for all PL games.
* Write unit tests
